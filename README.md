### :computer: PEWLETT-HACKARD ANALYSIS :computer:

## Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to help PH to both combine legacy CSV data into a relational database and to analyze the Silver Tsunami crisis and it's effects on various departments and roles throughout the company.

## Results
1. With 25,916 and 24,926 total retiring in Senior Engineer and Senior Staff, this represents over 70% of the retiring employees. The company will be losing a large amount of senior staff.
2. 50% of the retring staff are Engineers (Senior Engineers + Assistant Engineers + Engineers = 36,291 of the 72,458 retiring)
3. The eligible mentors for each group only represent around 2% of the retiring employees for all categories with eligble mentors.

## Summary
How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact? 
* 72,458 roles

Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees? 
* As there are only 1,549 qualified employees for the mentorship programe, there are not enough elegible to mentor the next generation. 

### Aditional Insight
1. It would be important to run an additional query to see how many employees are *not* retiring in each role. This would allow some additional context concerning how large the retiring group is compared to the current count in each role. Without this context, we can say the numbers are large, but not if they are signifigant. For instance, for the Technique Leaders, are 10% retiring or are 90% retiring. There would be signifigantly more urgency to determine a path forward if it is the later.

2. Many of those that are retiring are senior staff. Since these roles typically have a higher pay rate than those of the non-senior staff, creating a table that contains all of the salaries by role would help to determine how much salary expense can be recovered to hire more non-senior staff to make up for the retiring group, or room to promote current staff to the senior level.
